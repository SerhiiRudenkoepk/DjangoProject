to start server : python3 base/manage.py runserver

to create a new tab : python3 manage.py startapp shop (shop - name of the app/tab)

to CREATE a project from 0: django-admin startproject base (base - name of the project)

Why call the project base? Because it will be a main folder and you will know right 
away where the main folder is.

python3 manage.py migrate # used to migrate all the data to db.

# python manage.py createsuperuser  -> to create a superuser/admin
